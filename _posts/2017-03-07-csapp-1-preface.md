## What To Be Read
CS:APP is the short name for a great book called 
**_"Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective"_**

## Assumptions 
- Use the term “Unix” as an umbrella term for systems having Unix as 
their heritage, including Solaris, Mac OS, and Linux.
- Have some familiarity with C or C++.
- Do not assume any prior experience with hardware, machine language, 
or assembly-language programming.

## Aims
- Present the fundamental concepts in ways that you will find useful right away. 
You will also be prepared to delve deeper, studying such topics as compilers, computer 
architecture, operating systems, em-bedded systems, and networking.

- Other systems books are written from a builder’s perspective. This book is written from a 
**programmer’s perspective**, describing how application programmers can use their knowledge 
of a system to write better programs.  

- If you study and learn the concepts in this book, you will be on your way to
becoming the rare “**power programmer**” who knows how things work and how
to fix them when they break.


## What To Be Expected
Become Power Programmer.

## My Way to Read 
- More rely on diagrams to illustrate complicated concepts.
- Highlight emphasises.
- Code sample program by my own.
- Go over previous chapters frequently
- Find more materials on topic in each chapter to refine my understandings.
